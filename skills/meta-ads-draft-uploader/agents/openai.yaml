display_name: "Meta Ads Draft Uploader"
short_description: "Upload image/video assets and create PAUSED Meta Ads via Graph/Marketing API from a JSON spec."
default_prompt: "Create draft-safe Meta ads from local images/videos. Ask for ad_account_id, page_id, destination URL, copy, and media file paths. If campaign/ad set already exist, ask for IDs or names; otherwise create/reuse a PAUSED campaign+ad set using safe defaults. Then generate a spec.json and run the bundled script to upload assets, create creatives, and create PAUSED ads. Never create ACTIVE objects; instruct the user to activate in Ads Manager if needed."
